Sprint 1 Planning Meeting

*Note that most 'official' sprint planning was done over the previous few weeks as part of the 'User Stories, Release & Sprint Plan
criteria'.

--Discussed how not enough work had been completed, noting that as of now we are not on track to 
	complete sprint 1 and that we were beginning the sprint one week late.

--Made plans and organised short-term timelines to complete immediate work, specifically the creation of basic html to 
	allow for backend coding progress to start. Making allowances for Father's Day.

--Discussed database, and noted some minor changes that needed to be made.

--Discussed broad outlines on how to actually implement each webpage planned for sprint 1.

--All team members shown how git repositories worked.

--Concluded meeting.
